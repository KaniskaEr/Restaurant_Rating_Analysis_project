📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes restaurant ratings using real-world datasets of consumers, restaurants, cuisines, and preferences.
The goal is to uncover insights into:

Consumer behavior & dining preferences

Popular cuisines and restaurants

Rating distribution and trends

Data-driven recommendations for restaurant businesses

A Power BI dashboard (Restaurant Ratings Analysis.pbix) has been created to visualize these insights interactively.
